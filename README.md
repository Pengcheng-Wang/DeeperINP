# BayesianDeeperINP
In this repository, we implement Bayesian NN following Gal's method, also incorporate implementations of deeper NNs (Hightway NN, RHN, ResNet, GridLSTM) in player simulation modeling and DRL in interactive narrative personlization.

This repository is built on the prior Ijcai DRL-INP repository, which built on Torch and related libs from Jan 2017.

When this repository starts, newer Torch, RNN and other corresponding libs have been applied. (Oct 2017)
